# Online Voting System with Face Recognition

## Overview

This project implements an online voting system enhanced with facial recognition technology to improve security and accessibility. It addresses the challenges of traditional voting systems, such as long lines, limited resources, and the risk of fraud, by providing a convenient and secure digital platform for casting votes.

As outlined in the provided document, "Traditional voting systems often have problems. Long lines, limited resources, & the risk of fraud can make voting tough. But online voting is here to help. It gives voters a simple & easy way to cast their votes from anywhere." This system leverages machine learning, particularly facial recognition, to ensure voter identity verification and fraud prevention.

## Features

* **Facial Recognition Authentication:** Uses machine learning to verify voter identity, preventing impersonation and duplicate votes.
* **Enhanced Security:** Addresses issues like voter fraud and tampering through biometric authentication.
* **Improved Accessibility:** Enables individuals with mobility issues, disabilities, or those in remote locations to participate in elections.
* **Convenient Online Voting:** Allows voters to cast their votes from anywhere, reducing the need for physical polling places.
* **Fraud Detection:** Machine learning techniques aid in quickly identifying fraudulent activities.
* **Fair Elections:** Contributes to maintaining the integrity and fairness of the electoral process.
